<p>
        Tinywall is a mobile app designed to make car parking more convenient and memorable. It is developed using Flutter, offering a user-friendly experience. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As the Flutter developer for this project, I took charge of the mobile app's development and successfully contributed over 7 thousand lines of code in Flutter and Dart. The project is built following the MVVM structure, incorporating Mobx for state management and GetIt for dependency injection, ensuring a robust and organized codebase.

        Notably, Tinywall is currently available on the Google Play Store, bringing its innovative car parking solution to users worldwide.
